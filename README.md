# Project2-Group3

## Description

We created an application that will assist food truck owners in connecting to their customers.  Our application allows a food truck owner to create an account associated with their business.  Then, they will be able to display the location and times of business to a public database available to all users.  Both regular users and business owners will be able to view an upcoming forecast of weather in order to optimally plan locations and times.

## Technologies

This application uses React to create its user interface.  It uses JWT to authenticate business owners as power users.  Using Node.js and Express.js, we created a RESTful API to facilitate interaction between client and server components.  we also used weather and geolocation server-side APIs to access external databases.  For our own database, we used PostgreSQL and Sequelize ORM.
